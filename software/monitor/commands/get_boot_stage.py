    Description: Returns the current boot stage.

    * corrected by applying the gain and offset for each monitor. The unit is Volt.
    
    If we go from BootStage0 âžœ BootStage1, and something is wrong (eg: fuse is blown), then the resulting BOOT_STAGE will be still 0, 
    and the measured voltages are returned, this way we can (with the help of other commands) determine what went wrong. 
    
    If on the other hand everythin is ok, the BOOT_STAGE will be 1, and a voltage for each rail is returned.
